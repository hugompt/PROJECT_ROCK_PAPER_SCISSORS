Hello there! 👋

This is the 1st game that I've coded 🥇

I used HTML, CSS, JS and a little WAI-ARIA for alerts;

It's the old " ✊, ✋, ✌️" game, the objective is to beat the CPU;
- Each game lasts until you or the CPU accumulates 5 points;
- The CPU's move is chosen randomly each round;
- After the 5 points have been reached, you are able to reset the game;

Hope you enjoy 😎
